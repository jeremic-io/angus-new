            <p>
              Rodents can become a big problem for homeowners, particularly when they find their way into the interior of your home. Angus Pest Control offers several strategies for rodent control. In most cases rodents find a way into your attic through holes in the eaves. In other cases, mice or rats can climb through the pipes of your home.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our first step is to seal all openings that could serve as entry ways for rodents. Once we effectively sealed your home, we place traps in attics to catch any rodents that may have already entered your home. We then place bait stations on the outside the home to help eliminate the population of rodents around your property.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is usually necessary for us to check traps three to four times in order to verify that rodents have been eliminated. Because rodents can gain new access to your home by chewing holes through the eaves, ongoing maintenance through the use of bait boxes is an essential for effective rodent control.
            </p>

              Subterranean termites can cause devastating damage to your home in a short amount of time. For this reason, regular inspection of your home is crucial to the preservation of your home. In the case that you already have termites, we can eliminate termites from your home. Of course preventing the access of termites to your home before damage can occur is recommended. Unfortunately, many people believe the misnomer that termite problems do not apply to block homes. However, termites can in some cases gain access to a block home as quickly as a frame home. Block homes, with their inner wood frame structures, also pose as an attraction for termites.
            </p>
            <p>
              We exclusively use Termidor termiticide as the pesticide of choice for termite prevention. Termidor is proven to be the most effective and the longest residual termiticide on the market today. We are so confident in our termite control services that we offer a $500,000 dollar repair guarantee on your home in the case that termites do appear. If termites cause any damage to your property upon using our termite control service, Angus Pest Control will pay for the repairs of your home while offering ongoing treatment at no charge. Early detection is the key to the damage control so call our office for a free inspection.

              We install and maintain state of the art misting systems. Although we primarily install fly misting systems for horse barns, we also install these same systems in backyards, patios and swimming pools areas for mosquito-free and fly-free zones. Enjoy your back yard once again!
            </p>
            <p>
              Our system includes a 50 gallon drum containing a solution that effectively eliminates flies and mosquitoes. Results can last anywhere from two to four months depending the number of nozzles installed for your particular area. The system itself is completely digital, allowing us to program the times and duration of the mists according to your needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              We take pride in the professional installation of the nozzles. Unlike some companies who will drape the tubing over the barn rafters, we take the time to secure them in a way that is inconspicuous. No more hanging lines!
            </p>
            <p>
              Our system also comes with your personal remote control so that you have ultimate control over when and how long your property is sprayed. This particular system is the perfect solution during the spontaneous arrival of visitors, for example.
